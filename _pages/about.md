I am a PhD student at the University of California, Irvine studying applications of machine learning to healthcare. I am advised by Professor <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~smyth/">Padhraic Smyth</a>. Previously, I completed bachelor of science degrees in physics and computer science at Georgia Tech.

My current research interests include combining traditional survival analysis approaches with deep learning and fairness in machine learning applications to healthcare. In the past, I have also worked on developing automated gating for flow cytometry data in order to diagnose chronic lymphocytic luekemia. My current work is supported by an <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/hpi/">HPI Fellowship</a>.
